## Test Scenarios

| Scenario ID | Clinical Context (GIVEN/WHEN) | AI Recommended Action | Clinical Reasoning with Source |
|--------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **ACC-AFIB-001** | GIVEN a 65-year-old patient with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation AND no significant comorbidities<br>WHEN assessing stroke risk and anticoagulation needs | Calculate **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** and **HAS-BLED** scores; initiate **DOAC (e.g., apixaban)** if CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥2 (men) or ≥3 (women). | Stroke prevention is based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc score; oral anticoagulation preferred over warfarin for most non-valvular AF unless contraindicated. [AHA/ACC/HRS AFib Guideline 2024, Section 5.2] |
| **ACC-AFIB-002** | GIVEN a patient with atrial fibrillation AND CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3<br>WHEN deciding on anticoagulation strategy | Start **direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)**—apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban—unless contraindicated. | Score ≥2 warrants anticoagulation; DOACs reduce stroke/systemic embolism risk with lower major bleeding vs. warfarin. [AHA/ACC/HRS 2024 §6.1] |
| **ACC-AFIB-003** | GIVEN a patient with atrial fibrillation AND high bleeding risk (HAS-BLED ≥3)<br>WHEN selecting anticoagulation therapy | Use **apixaban** or **edoxaban** (lower bleeding profile); address reversible bleeding risks (BP control, limit NSAIDs, avoid alcohol excess). | HAS-BLED guides modifiable risk mitigation—not a reason to withhold anticoagulation. Apixaban shows best net benefit in high-risk patients. [AHA/ACC 2024 §6.5; ARISTOTLE Trial] |
| **ACC-AFIB-004** | GIVEN a patient with atrial fibrillation AND recent ischemic stroke<br>WHEN determining urgent anticoagulation needs | Begin **anticoagulation 3–14 days post-stroke** (timing depends on infarct size and hemorrhage risk); use **DOAC** if eligible. | Early anticoagulation lowers recurrent stroke risk; timing individualized per imaging and neurologic status. [AHA/ASA Stroke Guideline 2024; AHA/ACC AFib §7.3] |
| **ACC-AFIB-005** | GIVEN a patient with atrial fibrillation AND planned electrical cardioversion<br>WHEN preparing for procedure | Ensure **≥3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation pre-procedure** or perform **TEE to exclude thrombus**, then continue **≥4 weeks post-cardioversion**. | Anticoagulation around cardioversion prevents embolic stroke from atrial thrombus mobilization. [AHA/ACC 2024 §8.2] |
| **HODGKINS-001** | GIVEN a 28-year-old patient with stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma<br>WHEN planning initial chemotherapy regimen | Initiate **ABVD × 2 cycles + involved-site RT (ISRT 30 Gy)** or **BV-AVD × 4 cycles** for early-stage unfavorable disease. | Standard first-line therapy is ABVD-based; BV-AVD is acceptable alternative with comparable outcomes and less bleomycin toxicity. [NCCN Hodgkin Lymphoma v2.2025 HODG-4 & 5] |
| **HODGKINS-002** | GIVEN a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma AND bulky mediastinal disease<br>WHEN deciding on radiation therapy | Give **combined-modality therapy**: ABVD × 4–6 cycles + consolidative ISRT (30–36 Gy). | Bulky disease benefits from combined chemo-RT to reduce relapse; ISRT targets residual masses. [NCCN 2025 HODG-5 & HODG-C] |
| **HODGKINS-003** | GIVEN a patient completing ABVD chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma<br>WHEN planning response assessment | Perform **PET/CT (Deauville scale)** within 4–6 weeks after therapy; consider ISRT if Deauville 4–5. | PET-adapted therapy guides need for consolidation RT or further chemo; Deauville 1–3 = complete response. [NCCN 2025 HODG-4A; Lymphoma Response Criteria 2023] |
| **HODGKINS-004** | GIVEN a patient with relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma<br>WHEN considering salvage therapy options | Use **PD-1 inhibitor (nivolumab or pembrolizumab)** or **BV + bendamustine**; consider **auto-HCT** if eligible. | PD-1 blockade yields durable responses in relapsed HL; HCT offers curative potential in chemo-sensitive relapse. [NCCN 2025 HODG-13–15] |
| **HODGKINS-005** | GIVEN a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma AND treatment-related cardiotoxicity<br>WHEN modifying treatment plan | Discontinue **anthracycline (doxorubicin)**; switch to **BV-AVD (omit doxorubicin)** or **brentuximab + nivolumab** regimen. | Cardiotoxicity requires avoidance of anthracyclines; BV-based or immunotherapy regimens maintain efficacy. [NCCN 2025 HODG-B (1 of 8)] |
| **DIABETES-001** | GIVEN a 55-year-old patient with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes AND HbA1c 9.2%<br>WHEN initiating glucose-lowering therapy | Start **metformin + GLP-1 RA (or SGLT2 inhibitor)**; consider **basal insulin** if symptomatic or catabolic. | Dual therapy recommended when A1c ≥ 9%; GLP-1 RA preferred for weight loss and CV benefit. [ADA Standards of Care 2025 §9.4] |
| **DIABETES-002** | GIVEN a patient with type 2 diabetes AND diabetic nephropathy (eGFR 45 mL/min)<br>WHEN selecting appropriate medications | Continue **metformin** if eGFR ≥ 45; add **SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin/dapagliflozin)**; if not tolerated, use GLP-1 RA. | SGLT2 inhibitors slow CKD progression and reduce CV events; metformin safe ≥ 45 mL/min. [ADA 2025 §11.5; KDIGO-ADA Consensus 2024] |
| **DIABETES-003** | GIVEN a patient with type 2 diabetes AND recent cardiovascular event<br>WHEN managing cardiovascular risk | Add **GLP-1 RA (semaglutide/liraglutide)** or **SGLT2 inhibitor** with proven CV benefit to existing therapy. | These agents reduce MACE and mortality post-ASCVD event independent of A1c level. [ADA 2025 §10.2; AHA 2024 CV Prevention Guideline] |
| **DIABETES-004** | GIVEN a patient with type 2 diabetes AND obesity (BMI 35)<br>WHEN planning comprehensive management | Combine **GLP-1 RA (semaglutide or tirzepatide)** with lifestyle therapy; consider **bariatric surgery** if BMI ≥ 35 with comorbidity. | GLP-1/GIP agonists achieve substantial weight loss and A1c reduction; metabolic surgery improves long-term remission. [ADA 2025 §8.5 & §9.7] |
| **DIABETES-005** | GIVEN a patient with type 2 diabetes AND hypoglycemia unawareness<br>WHEN adjusting treatment regimen | De-intensify insulin or sulfonylurea; switch to GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor; implement CGM for monitoring. | Avoid hypoglycemia-prone agents and use CGM to detect asymptomatic episodes. [ADA 2025 §6.3 & §7.12] |
| **DIABETES-006** | GIVEN a 12-year-old patient with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes<br>WHEN planning initial treatment approach | Initiate **metformin + lifestyle therapy**; add **basal insulin** if A1c > 8.5% or symptomatic. | Early insulin corrects glucotoxicity in youth-onset T2DM; metformin is first-line if stable. [ADA 2025 §14.96] |
| **DIABETES-007** | GIVEN a pregnant patient with gestational diabetes<br>WHEN managing blood glucose during pregnancy | Begin **medical nutrition therapy** and glucose monitoring; start **insulin** if targets not met (avoid oral agents as first-line). | Insulin is preferred for safety and efficacy during pregnancy; diet and monitoring first-line. [ADA 2025 §15.4] |
| **DIABETES-008** | GIVEN a patient with type 1 diabetes AND frequent hypoglycemia<br>WHEN optimizing insulin regimen | Use **real-time CGM + insulin pump (AID system)**; adjust carbohydrate ratios and basal patterns. | Automated insulin delivery reduces severe hypoglycemia and improves time-in-range. [ADA 2025 §7.16 & §9.3] |
| **DIABETES-009** | GIVEN a patient with diabetes AND severe hyperglycemia (glucose 400 mg/dL)<br>WHEN providing urgent management | Evaluate for DKA/HHS; give **IV fluids**, **IV insulin drip**, and **electrolyte correction**; transition to SC insulin when stable. | Rapid volume resuscitation and IV insulin are standard for HHS/DKA; identify precipitants. [ADA 2025 §16.1] |
| **DIABETES-010** | GIVEN a patient with diabetes AND peripheral neuropathy<br>WHEN planning preventive care | Perform **annual foot exam**, optimize **glycemic control**, and start **duloxetine or pregabalin** for pain. | Neuropathy management prevents ulcers and amputation; pain control improves quality of life. [ADA 2025 §11.3 & §12.4] |
