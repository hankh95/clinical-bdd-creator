## Recommendations

Validation passed with minor warnings. Review the warnings and address them if they impact clarity or completeness. Proceed to Phase 5 with confidence.

## Standards Compliance Assessment

### EARS Compliance
- All 20 requirements follow EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) structure
- User stories clearly define actors and goals
- Acceptance criteria use WHEN/THE System SHALL format
- Quantifiable metrics included in acceptance criteria

### Clinical Standards
- FHIR R4/R5 resource usage documented
- Clinical terminology systems referenced (SNOMED CT, ICD-11)
- CDS Hooks integration specified
- CDS usage taxonomy aligned with industry standards

### Documentation Consistency
- Requirements aligned with 23 CDS usage scenarios
- 17 user personas referenced appropriately
- Service configuration integrated across layers
- Coverage architecture properly structured

## Integration Testing Recommendations

### Test Strategy for Phase 5

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test each requirement in isolation
   - Validate acceptance criteria are testable
   - Create unit tests for core functionality

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test requirement interactions
   - Validate FHIR resource generation end-to-end
   - Test CDS hooks integration points

3. **Clinical Validation Testing**
   - Validate against real clinical guidelines
   - Test with sample patient data
   - Verify clinical decision support accuracy

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Validate response time requirements
   - Test rate limiting and resilience
   - Load test critical workflows

## Next Steps for Phase 5

1. Address any critical validation issues
2. Review and approve validation report
3. Begin architectural design based on validated requirements
4. Create detailed implementation plan
5. Set up testing infrastructure aligned with recommendations
