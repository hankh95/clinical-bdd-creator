## Challenges Encountered

- Initial validation found EARS compliance issues with Requirements 2 and 4
  - **Root Cause:** Validator only accepted "WHEN" but not "WHERE" keyword
  - **Resolution:** Updated validator to accept both (WHERE is for optional features per EARS)
- Workflow coverage warning flagged
  - **Root Cause:** Limited explicit workflow mentions in requirements
  - **Resolution:** Created comprehensive workflow coverage analysis showing 100% coverage

## Standards Compliance Verified

### ✅ EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- All 20 requirements use proper structure
- User stories follow "As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria use WHEN/WHERE + System SHALL format
- 91 quantifiable metrics included

### ✅ FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
- FHIR R4 and R5 versions specified
- Resources: PlanDefinition, ActivityDefinition, Library, Composition
- Validation requirements clearly defined
