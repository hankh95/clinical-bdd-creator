# Daily Notes: November 8, 2025

**Session Start:** ~9:00 AM
**Session End:** Ongoing

## Tasks Completed

- Started Phase 3: Content Refinements
- Created `examples/bdd-tests/` folder structure for example BDD test scenarios
- Organized examples by clinical domain, generation mode, and fidelity level
- Added README with naming conventions and contribution guidelines
- Added comprehensive clinical BDD test examples to `examples/bdd-tests/unsorted/`
- Committed and pushed BDD examples to repository (17 files, 1075 lines)

## Decisions Made

- Daily notes will be created as new files each day (YYYY-MM-DD.md format)
- BDD examples folder structure supports multiple organization methods for flexibility
- File naming convention established: `{domain}-{mode}-{fidelity}-{scenario-id}.feature`

## Challenges Encountered

- None yet - folder structure creation went smoothly

## Next Steps

- **Phase 3 Work Completed:** GitHub Copilot coding agent successfully organized BDD examples
- PR #1 ready for review: "Organize BDD test examples into three-way classification system with clinical context"
- 5 examples organized across 52 files with clinical context and proper categorization
- Continue with Phase 3 content refinements (assumptions, dependencies, risks sections)
- Strengthen acceptance criteria with quantifiable metrics and negative scenarios
