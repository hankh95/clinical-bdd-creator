- **Structured ID System**: CDS scenarios use hierarchical IDs (1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.) suitable for test labeling
- **Next Phase Focus**: Review and integrate this documentation, design test labeling approach using usage scenario IDs

### Time Spent Today

- Requirements Analysis: 30 minutes
- Enhancement Work: 150 minutes (all 20 requirements)
- Documentation: 45 minutes (usage scenarios + user personas)
- **Total**: ~3.75 hours (session complete)

### ✅ Completed User-Centered Documentation

- **Usage Scenarios Documentation**: Created comprehensive 8-category framework for BDD test organization with detailed workflows, success criteria, and implementation guidelines
- **User Personas Documentation**: Developed 4 detailed personas (Clinical Knowledge Engineer, Test Automation Engineer, Clinical Informaticist, System Administrator) with demographics, goals, workflows, pain points, and design implications
- **Documentation Quality**: Fixed all markdown linting errors and ensured professional presentation with cross-references to EARS requirements
- **Integration Impact**: Both documents now inform requirements prioritization and provide context for user-centered design decisions

### ✅ Requirements Updated with Comprehensive Documentation

- **Core Requirements Updated**: Enhanced all 20 EARS requirements to reference detailed personas and CDS usage scenarios
- **Persona Integration**: Updated user stories to reference specific personas (e.g., `Persona_Clinical_Informaticist.md`, `Persona_CDS_Integration_Architect.md`)
- **Usage Scenario Alignment**: Added references to CDS use cases (e.g., "aligns with CDS Use Cases 1.2.1-1.2.3: Post-Action Error Prevention")
- **Documentation Cross-References**: Requirements now link to the comprehensive 23-use-case CDS scenarios and 17 detailed persona files
- **Version Update**: Bumped core requirements to version 2.0.0 to reflect comprehensive documentation integration

### Next Steps: Test Labeling Design

- **ID System Analysis**: CDS scenarios use structured hierarchical IDs (1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.) perfect for test tagging
- **Labeling Convention**: Design `@usage-scenarios:1.1.1,1.1.3,1.2.1` format for BDD test headers
- **Implementation**: Apply labels to existing test examples and establish standards for future tests

### ✅ Test Labeling Convention Designed

- **Tag Format Established**: `@usage-scenarios:1.1.1,1.1.3,1.2.1` with `@decision-questions:treatment_now,tests_now`
- **ID System Integration**: Leverages the hierarchical CDS scenario IDs (1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.) from comprehensive documentation
- **Coverage Mapping**: Created mapping table linking ID ranges to clinical use case categories
- **Example Tests**: Provided concrete examples for drug recommendations, diagnostic tests, and risk stratification
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Defined rules for multiple scenarios, decision question priority, and maintenance
- **Benefits Documented**: Traceability, coverage analysis, requirements validation, and regression prevention
