# Daily Notes: November 7, 2025

**Session Start:** ~10:00 AM  
**Session End:** Ongoing  

## Tasks Completed

- Reviewed EARS requirements in `spec-pack/01-ears/clinical-bdd-mcp_service_requirements.md`.
- Provided suggestions for improvements (EARS compliance, structure, MCP elements, etc.).
- Created `prompts/` directory and added `core_prompt.md` with instructions for collaborative work (daily notes every 2-3 hours, at stop points, commits).
- Created `spec-pack/11-plan/` directory and moved development plan to `spec-pack/11-plan/development_plan.md`.
- Set up `daily-notes/` folder for tracking work and decisions.

## Decisions Made

- Use `daily-notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for daily tracking, updated per core prompt.
- Place development plan in `spec-pack/11-plan/` to keep spec-pack organized.
- Core prompt will guide AI behavior for consistent collaboration.

## Challenges Encountered

- Initial confusion on file locations; clarified to separate daily notes from development plan.
- Tool call issues with multiple filePaths; resolved by creating files separately.

## Next Steps

- Prioritize the suggestion list from the requirements review.
- Begin Phase 1 of the development plan (planning and prioritization).
- Update this file at next stop point or in 2-3 hours.

**Update: 11:30 AM** - Completed prioritization of improvement suggestions. All 6 categories will be addressed in order:

1. EARS compliance improvements
2. Structure enhancements
3. Completeness additions
4. MCP elements strengthening
5. Quality assurance improvements
6. Refinements

Starting work on Category 1: EARS compliance improvements.

**Progress on Category 1 - EARS Compliance:**

- ✅ Added specific time limits (30s, 10s) and quantifiable thresholds (≥3 sections, ≥1000 chars/section)
- ✅ Defined file patterns with backticks to avoid markdown issues  
- ✅ Added minimum scenario counts (≥5, 3-5 per section, ≥2 external)
- ✅ Defined complexity categories quantitatively (Simple ≤2 steps, Moderate 3-5, etc.)
- ✅ Added success rate targets (≥95%, ≥80% coverage, ≥90% deduplication)
- ✅ Added negative scenarios and error conditions

**Issue Identified:** Document has duplicate headings (both ### and #### level) causing lint errors. This will be addressed in Category 2 (Structure improvements).
