# Daily Notes: November 7, 2025

**Session Start:** ~10:00 AM  
**Session End:** Ongoing  

## Tasks Completed

- Reviewed EARS requirements in `spec-pack/01-ears/clinical-bdd-mcp_service_requirements.md`.
- Provided suggestions for improvements (EARS compliance, structure, MCP elements, etc.).
- Created `prompts/` directory and added `core_prompt.md` with instructions for collaborative work (daily notes every 2-3 hours, at stop points, commits).
- Created `spec-pack/11-plan/` directory and moved development plan to `spec-pack/11-plan/development_plan.md`.
- Set up `daily-notes/` folder for tracking work and decisions.

## Decisions Made

- Use `daily-notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for daily tracking, updated per core prompt.
- Place development plan in `spec-pack/11-plan/` to keep spec-pack organized.
- Core prompt will guide AI behavior for consistent collaboration.

## Challenges Encountered

- Initial confusion on file locations; clarified to separate daily notes from development plan.
- Tool call issues with multiple filePaths; resolved by creating files separately.

## Next Steps

- Prioritize the suggestion list from the requirements review.
- Begin Phase 1 of the development plan (planning and prioritization).
- Update this file at next stop point or in 2-3 hours.

**Update: 11:30 AM** - Completed prioritization of improvement suggestions. All 6 categories will be addressed in order:

1. EARS compliance improvements
2. Structure enhancements
3. Completeness additions
4. MCP elements strengthening
5. Quality assurance improvements
6. Refinements

Starting work on Category 1: EARS compliance improvements.

**Progress on Category 1 - EARS Compliance:**

- ✅ Added specific time limits (30s, 10s) and quantifiable thresholds (≥3 sections, ≥1000 chars/section)
- ✅ Defined file patterns with backticks to avoid markdown issues  
- ✅ Added minimum scenario counts (≥5, 3-5 per section, ≥2 external)
- ✅ Defined complexity categories quantitatively (Simple ≤2 steps, Moderate 3-5, etc.)
- ✅ Added success rate targets (≥95%, ≥80% coverage, ≥90% deduplication)
- ✅ Added negative scenarios and error conditions

**Issue Identified:** Document has duplicate headings (both ### and #### level) causing lint errors. This will be addressed in Category 2 (Structure improvements).

**Category 1 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - EARS compliance significantly improved with quantifiable metrics, time limits, and negative scenarios.

**Next:** Start Category 2 - Structure enhancements (fix duplicate headings, improve document organization).

**Category 2 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Document structure improved with:

- Removed duplicate requirement summaries causing lint errors
- Added comprehensive table of contents with navigation links
- Added detailed glossary with clinical and technical terms
- Added change log for version tracking
- Improved document organization and readability

**Category 3 Progress:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Added comprehensive testing methodology requirements:

- **Requirement 18**: Multi-Modal AI Validation Testing (consistency across GPT-4, Claude, Gemini ≥80%)
- **Requirement 19**: Clinical Reasoning Benchmarking (precision/recall metrics, explanation completeness)
- **Requirement 20**: Integration Testing with Healthcare Systems (FHIR validation, CDS hooks, performance benchmarking)

**Phase 1 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - All Categories (1-3) finished:

- Category 1: EARS compliance improvements ✅
- Category 2: Document structure enhancements ✅  
- Category 3: Content refinements with testing methodology ✅

**Lint Error Resolution:** Fixed most markdown lint errors:

- ✅ Added missing Glossary and Change Log sections
- ✅ Fixed blank line formatting around headings and code blocks
- ✅ Resolved duplicate section headings and invalid link fragments
- ⚠️ Remaining: Duplicate "Acceptance Criteria" headings (expected in requirements documents - each requirement has its own section)

**Next Steps:**

- Begin Phase 2: Implementation of requirements and development tasks.
- Focus on high-priority items from the development plan.
- Schedule regular reviews to ensure alignment with project goals.

---

**Phase 2 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Structural improvements implemented:

- **Modularized Documentation**: Split monolithic requirements into focused modules:

  - `spec-pack/09-mcp/mcp-specifications.md`: MCP protocol, tools, security, client configs
  - `spec-pack/01-ears/core-requirements.md`: 20 detailed EARS requirements with workflow diagrams
  - `spec-pack/01-ears/glossary.md`: 50+ comprehensive term definitions
  - `spec-pack/01-ears/changelog.md`: Version history and change tracking
  - `spec-pack/README.md`: Main index with navigation and architecture overview

- **Added Visual Diagrams**: Created Mermaid diagrams for:

  - MCP server architecture (clients → server → tools → data stores)
  - BDD generation workflow (guidelines → generation modes → fidelity control → outputs)
  - AI validation testing workflow (multi-modal consistency → benchmarking → integration)

- **Enhanced Navigation**: Improved cross-references and table of contents across all modules
- **Expanded Glossary**: Added clinical informatics, AI/ML, healthcare standards terminology
- **Version Control**: Updated change log with Phase 2 improvements and version 1.2.0 release

**Phase 3 Preview:** Content refinements upcoming:

- Add assumptions, dependencies, and risks sections
- Strengthen acceptance criteria with metrics and negative scenarios
- Refine MCP tools with detailed schemas and idempotency requirements
- Expand security/compliance documentation for PHI handling
