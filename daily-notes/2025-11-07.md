# Daily Notes: November 7, 2025

**Session Start:** ~10:00 AM  
**Session End:** Ongoing  

## Tasks Completed

- Reviewed EARS requirements in `spec-pack/01-ears/clinical-bdd-mcp_service_requirements.md`.
- Provided suggestions for improvements (EARS compliance, structure, MCP elements, etc.).
- Created `prompts/` directory and added `core_prompt.md` with instructions for collaborative work (daily notes every 2-3 hours, at stop points, commits).
- Created `spec-pack/11-plan/` directory and moved development plan to `spec-pack/11-plan/development_plan.md`.
- Set up `daily-notes/` folder for tracking work and decisions.

## Decisions Made

- Use `daily-notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for daily tracking, updated per core prompt.
- Place development plan in `spec-pack/11-plan/` to keep spec-pack organized.
- Core prompt will guide AI behavior for consistent collaboration.

## Challenges Encountered

- Initial confusion on file locations; clarified to separate daily notes from development plan.
- Tool call issues with multiple filePaths; resolved by creating files separately.

## Next Steps

- Prioritize the suggestion list from the requirements review.
- Begin Phase 1 of the development plan (planning and prioritization).
- Update this file at next stop point or in 2-3 hours.</content>
