# Expected Clinical Actions
expectations:
  recommendations:
    - type: "medication"
      drug_class: "SGLT2 inhibitor"
      rationale: "First-line for diabetes with ASCVD - proven cardiovascular benefit"
      options:
        - name: "empagliflozin"
        - name: "dapagliflozin"
        - name: "canagliflozin"
      considerations: "Cardiorenal protection regardless of glycemic control"
      evidence: "EMPA-REG, CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI trials"
    
    - type: "medication"
      drug_class: "GLP-1 receptor agonist"
      rationale: "First-line for diabetes with ASCVD - proven cardiovascular benefit"
      options:
        - name: "liraglutide"
        - name: "semaglutide"
        - name: "dulaglutide"
      considerations: "Alternative or addition to SGLT2i for ASCVD protection"
      evidence: "LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, REWIND trials"
    
    - type: "medication"
      drug_class: "Metformin"
      status: "consider as adjunct"
      rationale: "Traditional first-line agent, may be used alongside SGLT2i/GLP-1 RA"
      note: "No longer sole first-line in high-risk ASCVD patients per ADA 2025"
  
  treatment_strategy:
    approach: "Escalate to dual therapy with cardioprotective agents"
    priority: "SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA first-line for ASCVD"
    rationale: "High HbA1c (8.5%) + established ASCVD mandates aggressive cardioprotective therapy"
    targets:
      hba1c: "< 7%"
      cardiovascular_risk: "reduction through evidence-based agents"
  
  monitoring:
    - type: "labs"
      tests: ["HbA1c"]
      frequency: "every 3 months"
      target: "< 7%"
      rationale: "Monitor glycemic control response to therapy"
    
    - type: "labs"
      tests: ["eGFR", "creatinine"]
      frequency: "baseline and periodic"
      rationale: "Monitor renal function for SGLT2i safety and cardiorenal protection"
    
    - type: "labs"
      tests: ["lipid panel"]
      frequency: "periodic"
      rationale: "Comprehensive cardiovascular risk management"
    
    - type: "clinical"
      parameters: ["blood pressure", "weight"]
      frequency: "each visit"
      rationale: "Monitor cardiovascular status and treatment effects"
    
    - type: "cardiovascular"
      assessments: ["ASCVD status", "cardiac symptoms"]
      frequency: "ongoing"
      rationale: "Monitor for cardiovascular events and therapy efficacy"
