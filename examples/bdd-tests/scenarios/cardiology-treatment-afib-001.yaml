# Expected Clinical Actions
expectations:
  recommendations:
    - type: "medication"
      drug_class: "Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC)"
      specific: "apixaban"
      dose: "to be adjusted for obesity and renal function"
      route: "oral"
      rationale: "Stroke prevention with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2; preferred over warfarin in obesity"
      indication: "stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation"
    
    - type: "medication"
      drug_class: "Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker"
      specific: "diltiazem"
      indication: "rate control"
      rationale: "Appropriate rate control agent when beta-blockers contraindicated by COPD"
      avoid: "beta-blockers due to COPD"
    
    - type: "medication"
      drug_class: "LAMA inhaler"
      specific: "tiotropium"
      status: "continue"
      rationale: "Ongoing COPD management"
    
    - type: "lifestyle"
      intervention: "weight loss program"
      rationale: "Obesity management to reduce cardiovascular risk"
    
    - type: "lifestyle"
      intervention: "exercise program"
      rationale: "Cardiovascular health and weight management"
      considerations: "as tolerated with COPD"
    
    - type: "referral"
      service: "nutrition counseling"
      rationale: "Support for weight loss and dietary modifications"
  
  monitoring:
    - type: "cardiac"
      parameters: ["heart rate", "rhythm"]
      frequency: "regular intervals"
      targets: "rate control goals"
    
    - type: "labs"
      tests: ["renal function", "liver function"]
      timing: "baseline and periodic"
      frequency: "every 3-6 months"
      rationale: "Monitor for anticoagulation safety and DOAC dosing"
    
    - type: "labs"
      tests: ["CBC"]
      frequency: "every 3 months"
      rationale: "Monitor for bleeding risk with anticoagulation"
    
    - type: "labs"
      tests: ["HbA1c"]
      frequency: "every 3 months within 6 months"
      rationale: "Screen for metabolic complications of obesity"
    
    - type: "clinical"
      parameters: ["bleeding symptoms", "stroke symptoms"]
      frequency: "ongoing patient education and monitoring"
      rationale: "Early detection of anticoagulation complications"
  
  rhythm_management:
    strategy: "rate control"
    rationale: "Initial management with rate control; assess for rhythm control if symptomatic"
    note: "rhythm control can be considered if patient remains symptomatic"
