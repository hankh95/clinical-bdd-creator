# Expected Clinical Actions
expectations:
  recommendations:

      rationale: "First-line renin-angiotensin inhibition for HFrEF"
      special_instructions: "36-hour ACE inhibitor washout if applicable"
    
    - type: "medication"
      drug_class: "beta-blocker"
      specific: "metoprolol succinate"
      dose_initial: "12.5 mg daily"
      dose_target: "titrate up"
      route: "oral"
      rationale: "Evidence-based beta-blocker for HFrEF mortality benefit"
      titration: "uptitrate every 2 weeks as tolerated"
    
    - type: "medication"

      monitoring_required: "potassium and renal function in 3-7 days"
    
    - type: "medication"
      drug_class: "SGLT2 inhibitor"
      specific: "dapagliflozin"
      dose: "10 mg daily"
      route: "oral"
      rationale: "Cardiorenal protection regardless of diabetes status"
      alternatives:
