notes: 'Summary: This patient (67-year-old male with metastatic castration-resistant
  prostate cancer [mCRPC], history of prostatectomy, radiation, hormone therapy failure,
  rising PSA, bone metastases, and enrollment in SWOG 0421 trial with docetaxel-based
  regimen) is meant to test CIKG v8''s handling of NCCN/AUA guidelines for advanced
  prostate cancer. Specifically: L1 semantic relationships (e.g., prostate cancer
  treatedWith docetaxel, increasesRiskOf bone mets); L2 reusable logic (e.g., PSA
  monitoring goals, Gleason score risk stratification via CQL, measures for disease
  progression); L3 workflows (e.g., temporal sequencing post-hormone failure: trial
  enrollment, chemo cycles q3w, bisphosphonate for bone health); and CDS use cases
  like Treatment Recommendation (docetaxel for symptomatic mCRPC), Risk Stratification
  (high Gleason 8 prompting aggressive therapy), and Diagnostic Test Recommendation
  (serial PSA/bone scans).

  Expected Recommendations (BDD-style commented expectation, verified per NCCN Prostate
  Cancer guidelines and SWOG 0421 details):

  Given mCRPC with bone mets and trial enrollment,

  When managing per guidelines,

  Then recommend:

  - Continue zoledronic acid 4 mg IV q4w for bone health.

  - Administer docetaxel 75 mg/m² IV q3w + prednisone 5 mg PO BID (per trial; atrasentan/placebo
  randomized).

  - Monitor PSA q3-6 months, bone scans/CT as needed for progression.

  - Pain management with hydrocodone as required.

  - Consider denosumab alternative if renal issues; radium-223 for symptomatic bone
  mets if progression.'
