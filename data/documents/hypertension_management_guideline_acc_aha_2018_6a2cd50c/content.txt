# Sample Clinical Guideline: Hypertension Management

## Introduction

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of hypertension in adults.

## Definition and Classification

### Blood Pressure Categories
- **Normal**: Systolic < 120 mmHg and Diastolic < 80 mmHg
- **Elevated**: Systolic 120-129 mmHg and Diastolic < 80 mmHg
- **Stage 1 Hypertension**: Systolic 130-139 mmHg or Diastolic 80-89 mmHg
- **Stage 2 Hypertension**: Systolic ≥ 140 mmHg or Diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg

### Measurement Techniques
Blood pressure should be measured using a validated device with an appropriately sized cuff. Measurements should be taken after the patient has been seated quietly for at least 5 minutes, with the arm supported at heart level.

## Initial Evaluation

### History and Physical Examination
- Assess for cardiovascular risk factors
- Evaluate for secondary causes of hypertension
- Perform comprehensive physical examination

### Diagnostic Tests
- Basic metabolic panel (electrolytes, creatinine, glucose)
- Lipid profile
- Urinalysis
- Electrocardiogram (ECG)

## Treatment Recommendations

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Weight reduction if overweight
- DASH eating plan
- Dietary sodium reduction (< 2.4 g/day)
- Increased physical activity
- Moderation of alcohol consumption

### Pharmacologic Treatment

#### First-Line Agents
- Thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)
- ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril)
- ARBs (e.g., losartan)
- Calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine)

#### Combination Therapy
For patients requiring additional blood pressure reduction, combination therapy with two first-line agents from different classes is recommended.

## Follow-up and Monitoring

### Frequency of Visits
- Initial follow-up: Within 1 month
- Subsequent visits: Every 3-6 months depending on control

### Home Blood Pressure Monitoring
Home blood pressure monitoring is recommended for:
- Diagnosis of hypertension
- Assessment of treatment effectiveness
- Detection of white coat hypertension

## Special Populations

### Elderly Patients
Treatment should be initiated cautiously in patients ≥ 80 years old, starting with lower doses and titrating slowly.

### Patients with Diabetes
Blood pressure target: < 130/80 mmHg

### Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease
Blood pressure target: < 130/80 mmHg
ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred first-line agents.
