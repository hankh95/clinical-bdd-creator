Over the past four decades, evidence\nhas accumulated supporting more inten-\nsive insulin replacement, using multipledaily injections of insulin or continuoussubcutaneous administration through an\ninsulin pump, as providing the best com-\nbination of effectiveness and safety forpeople with type 1 diabetes.\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive\ntherapy with multiple daily injections or\ncontinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion(CSII) reduced A1C and was associatedwith improved long-term outcomes (1 –3).\nThe study was carried out with short-acting\n(regular) and intermediate-acting (NPH)\nhuman insulins. In this landmark trial,lower A1C with intensive management(7%) led to /C2450% reductions in micro-\nvascular complications over 6 years of\ntreatment. However, intensive therapy wasassociated with a higher rate of severehypoglycemia than conventional treat-\nment (62 compared with 19 episodes per\n100 person-years of therapy) (1). Follow-up of participants from the DCCT demon-strated fewer macrovascular and micro-vascular complications in the group that\nreceived intensive treatment. Achieving\nintensive glycemic goals during the activetreatment period of the study had a per-sistent bene ﬁcial impact over the 20 years\nafter the active treatment component of\nthe study ended (1 –3).\nInsulin replacement plans typically con-\nsist of basal insulin, mealtime insulin, andcorrection insulin ( Fig. 9.1 ) (4). Basal insu-\nlin includes NPH insulin, long-acting insu-\nlin analogs, and continuous delivery ofrapid-acting insulin via an insulin pump.Basal insulin analogs have longer duration\nof action with ﬂatter, more constant and\nconsistent plasma concentrations andactivity pro ﬁles than NPH insulin; rapid-\nacting analogs (RAA) have a quicker onsetand peak and shorter duration of action\nthan regular human insulin. In people\nwith type 1 diabetes, treatment with ana-log insulins is associated with less hypo-glycemia and weight gain and lower A1C\ncompared with injectable human insulins\n(5–7). Two injectable ultra-rapid-actinganalog (URAA) insulin formulations are\navailable that contain excipients that ac-celerate absorption and provide more ac-\ntivity in the ﬁrst portion of their pro ﬁle\ncompared with the other RAA (8,9). In-haled human insulin has a rapid peak andshortened duration of action comparedwith RAA (10) (see also subsection\nALTERNA-\n",

These newer for-\nmulations may cause less hypoglycemiawhile improving postprandial glucoseexcursions and administration ﬂexibility (in\nrelation to prandial intake) compared with\nRAA (10 –12). In addition, longer-acting\nbasal analogs (U-300 glargine or deglu-dec) may confer a lower hypoglycemiarisk compared with U-100 glargine in in-dividuals with type 1 diabetes (13,14).\nDespite the advantages of insulin ana-\nlogs in individuals with type 1 diabetes,the expense and/or complexity of treat-ment required for their use may be pro-hibitive ( Table 9.1 ). There are multiple\napproaches to insulin treatment. The cen-\ntral precept in the management of type 1\ndiabetes is that some form of insulin begiven in a de ﬁned treatment plan tailored\nto the individual to prevent diabetic ke-toacidosis (DKA) and minimize clinically\nrelevant hypoglycemia while achieving the\nindividual ’s glycemic goals. The impact of\nthe introduction of interchangeable biosi-milars and unbranded versions of someanalog products as well as current and up-coming price reductions on insulin access\nneed to be evaluated.

A systematicreview and meta-analysis concluded that\nCSII via pump therapy has modest advan-\ntages for lowering A1C ( /C00.30% [95% CI\n/C00.58 to /C00.02]) and for reducing severe\nhypoglycemia rates in children and adults(15).

How-\never, there is no consensus to guide thechoice of injection or pump therapy in agiven individual, and research to guidethis decision-making is needed (4). Inte-\ngration of continuous glucose monitoring\n(CGM) into the treatment plan soon afterdiagnosis improves glycemic outcomes,decreases hypoglycemic events, and im-\nproves quality of life for individuals with\ntype 1 diabetes (18 –23). Its use is now\nconsidered standard of care for most peo-ple with type 1 diabetes (4) (see Section 7,\n“Diabetes Technology ”). Reduction of noc-\nturnal hypoglycemia in individuals withtype 1 diabetes using insulin pumps withCGM is improved by automatic suspen-\nsion of insulin delivery at a preset glucose\nlevel, with further improvements whenusing devices with predictive low-glucoseinsulin delivery suspension (24,25).\nAutomated insulin delivery (AID) sys-\ntems are safe and effective for people\nwith type 1 diabetes. Randomized con-trolled trials and real-world studies havedemonstrated the ability of commercially\navailable systems to improve achievement\nof glycemic goals while reducing the risk ofhypoglycemia (26 –31). Data are emerging\non the safety and effectiveness of do-it-yourself systems (32,33). Evidence sug-\ngests that an AID hybrid closed-loop sys-\ntem is superior to AID sensor-augmentedpump therapy for increased percentageof time in range and reduction of hypogly-\ncemia (34,35).\nIntensive insulin management using a\nversion of CSII and CGM should be con-sidered in individuals with type 1 diabeteswhenever feasible. AID systems are pre-\nferred and should be considered for indi-\nviduals with type 1 diabetes who arec a p a b l eo fu s i n gt h ed e v i c es a f e l y( e i t h e rby themselves or with a caregiver) to im-\nprove time in range and reduce A1C and\nhypoglycemia (26,28 –31,36 –42). When\nchoosing among insulin delivery systems,individual preferences, cost, insulin type,\ndosing plan, and self-management capabil-\nities should be considered. See Section 7,“Diabetes Technology, ”for a full discussion\nof insulin delivery devices.\nIn general, individuals with type 1 dia-\nbetes require approximately 30 –50% of\ntheir daily insulin as basal and the remain-d e ra sp r a n d i a l( 4 3 ) .T h i sp r o p o r t i o nd e -pends on several factors, including butnot limited to carbohydrate consumption,\nage, pregnancy status, and puberty stage\n(4,44 –48). Total daily insulin requirementscan be estimated based on weight, with\ntypical doses ranging from 0.4 to 1 unit/kg/day. Higher amounts may be requiredduring puberty, menses, and medical ill-ness.

This guideline provides\ndetailed information on intensi ﬁcation\nof therapy to meet individualized needs.In addition, the American Diabetes Asso-\nciation (ADA) position statement “Type 1\nDiabetes Management Through the LifeSpan ”provides a thorough overview of\ntype 1 diabetes treatment (52).\nTypical multidose treatment plans for\nindividuals with type 1 diabetes combine\npremeal use of prandial insulins with alonger-acting formulation.

Postprandial\nglucose excursions are best managed by a\nwell-timed injection or inhalation of pran-dial insulin. Prandial insulin should ideallybe administered prior to meal consump-\ntion; however, the optimal time to admin-\nister varies based on the pharmacokineticsof the formulation (regular, RAA, or inhaled),the premeal blood glucose level, and carbo-\nhydrate consumption. Recommendations\nfor prandial insulin dose administrationshould therefore be individualized. Physi-ologic insulin secretion varies with glyce-mia, meal size, meal composition, and\ntissue demand for glucose. To address\nthis variability in people treated with insu-lin, strategies have evolved to adjustprandial doses based on predicted needs.\nThus, education on how to adjust pran-\ndial insulin to account for nutritional in-take and the correction dose based onpremeal glucose levels, anticipated activ-\nity, and sick-day management can be ef-\nfective and should be offered to most\nindividuals (53 –58). Education regardingadjustment of prandial insulin dose for\nglycemic trends should be provided to in-\ndividuals who are using CGM alone or anAID system (59 –62). Further adjustment\nof prandial insulin doses for nutritional in-take of protein and fat, in addition to car-\nbohydrates, is recommended but may be\nmore feasible for individuals using CSIIthan for those using multiple daily injec-tions (55). With some AID systems, use ofas i m p l i ﬁed meal announcement method\nmay be an alternative for prandial insulin\ndosing (31,63). Assessment and educa-\ntion tailored to improve health literacyand numeracy may be necessary for indi-viduals to effectively use various insulindosing strategies and tools (64,65) (see\nSection 5, “Facilitating Positive Health\nBehaviors and Well-being to ImproveHealth Outcomes, ”and Section 7, “Diabetes\nTechnology ”).\nThe 2021 ADA/European Association\nfor the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consen-sus report on the management of type 1\ndiabetes in adults summarizes different in-\nsulin plans and glucose monitoring strate-gies in individuals with type 1 diabetes(Fig. 9.1 andTable 9.1 )( 4 ) .\nInsulin Administration Technique\nEnsuring that individuals and/or caregivers\nunderstand correct insulin administrationtechnique is important to optimize glyce-\nmic management and insulin use safety.\nRecommendations have been publishedelsewhere outlining best practices for in-sulin administration (66). Proper insulinadministration technique includes thefollowing: injection, insertion of patch or\ninfusion (for CSII or AID systems) into ap-\npropriate body areas, or oral inhalation(inhaled human insulin); injection or in-fusion site rotation; appropriate care ofinjection or infusion sites to avoid infec-\ntion or other complications; avoidance of\nintramuscular (IM) insulin delivery; andﬁlling of the reservoir (for bolus patch,\nCSII, or AID systems) or inhaler (for in-haled human insulin) depending on themethod of administration. Selection of\nmethod of administration (vial and sy-\nringe, insulin pen, insulin patch, inhaledinsulin, connected insulin pens/devices,or insulin pumps) will depend on a vari-ety of individual-speci ﬁcf a c t o r sa n d\nneeds, cost and coverage, and individual\npreferences. Reassessment of the appro-\npriate administration technique shouldbe completed during routine follow-up.diabetesjournals.org/care Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment S185Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S181/791515/dc25s009.pdf by Duke University Medical Center Library user on 10 August 2025\nExogenously delivered insulin should\nbe injected or infused into subcutaneoustissue, not intramuscularly.

Recent evidence supports\nthe use of short needles (e.g., 4-mm pen\nneedles) as effective and well tolerated\ncompared with longer needles, includinga study performed in adults with obesity\n(67).\nInjection or infusion site rotation is ad-\nditionally necessary to avoid lipohypertro-\nphy, an accumulation of subcutaneous fat\nin response to the adipogenic actions of\ninsulin at a site of multiple injections. Lipo-\nhypertrophy appears as soft, smooth raisedareas several centimeters in breadth and\ncan contribute to erratic insulin absorption,\nincreased glycemic variability, and unex-plained hypoglycemic episodes. People\ntreated with insulin and/or caregivers\nshould receive education about proper\ninjection or infusion site rotation and how\nto recognize and avoid injecting in areas oflipohypertrophy. As noted in Table 4.1 ,e x -\namination of insulin administration sites\nfor the presence of lipohypertrophy, as\nwell as assessment of administration de-\nvice use and injection technique, are keycomponents of a comprehensive diabetes\nmedical evaluation and treatment plan.\nProper insulin injection, infusion, or inha-\nlation technique may lead to more effec-\ntive use of this therapy and, as such,holds the potential for improved clinical\noutcomes.\nNoninsulin Treatments for Type 1\nDiabetes\nInjectable and oral noninsulin glucose-\nlowering medications have been studiedfor their ef ﬁcacy as adjuncts to insulin\ntreatment of type 1 diabetes. Pramlintide\nis based on the naturally occurring b-cell\npeptide amylin and is approved for use in\nadults with type 1 diabetes. Clinical trialshave demonstrated a modest reduction\nin A1C (0.3 –0.4%) and modest weightloss (/C241 kg) with pramlintide (68). Similar\nresults have been reported for severalagents currently approved only for thetreatment of type 2 diabetes. The addi-tion of metformin in adults with type 1\ndiabetes was associated with small re-\nductions in body weight, insulin dose,and lipid levels but did not sustainablyimprove A1C (69,70). The largest clinical\ntrials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor\nagonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 1 diabeteshave been conducted with liraglutide1.8 mg daily, and results showed modest\nA1C reductions ( /C240.4%), decreases in\nweight ( /C245 kg), and reductions in insulin\ndoses (71,72). Liraglutide was also as-sessed for impact on C-peptide in individu-als with type 1 diabetes and residual\nb-cell function. During treatment there\nwas no impact, and with liraglutide dis-continuation there was worsening of C-peptide loss compared with placebo\n(73). Retrospective case series have re-\nvealed potential bene ﬁts on body weight\nand glycemic metrics with addition ofsemaglutide or tirzepatide for individuals\nwith type 1 diabetes and obesity (74,75).\nProspective studies using semaglutideare ongoing (76,77).\nSodium –glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)\ninhibitors have been studied in clinical\ntrials in people with type 1 diabetes, and\nresults showed improvements in A1C, re-duced body weight, and improved bloodpressure (78); however, SGLT2 inhibitoruse in type 1 diabetes was associated\nwith an increased rate of DKA (79). The\nSGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagli ﬂozin has been\nstudied in clinical trials in people withtype 1 diabetes, and results showed im-\nprovements in A1C and body weight (80);\nhowever, sotagli ﬂozin use was associated\nwith an eightfold increase in DKA com-pared with placebo (81). The studies that\nled to the approved indication for heart\nfailure (HF) excluded individuals with type 1diabetes or a history of DKA (82,83). See\nSGLT INHIBITION AND RISK OF KETOSIS ,l a t e ri nt h i s\nsection, and PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF\nHEART FAILURE in Section 10, “Cardiovascular\nDisease and Risk Management, ”for infor-\nmation on risk mitigation with the use ofSGLT inhibitors in those with type 1 dia-\nbetes. The risks and bene ﬁts of adjunctive\nagents continue to be evaluated, withconsensus statements providing guidanceon selection of candidates for treatment\nand precautions (84).\nThere are currently no approved thera-\npies for preservation of C-peptide ordelaying the progression of symptomatic\ntype 1 diabetes. Higher C-peptide levelshave been associated with better A1C,lower risk of retinopathy, lower risk ofnephropathy, and lower risk of severehypoglycemia (85). Various therapies,including verapamil, menin inhibitors,Janus kinase inhibitors, antithymocyteglobulin, several monoclonal antibodiesincluding teplizumab, and cell therapies,are currently under active investigation.\n",

Weight\nmanagement is a distinct treatment goal,along with glycemic management, as ithas multifaceted bene ﬁts, including reduc-\ntion of A1C, reduction in hepatic steatosis,\nand improvement in cardiovascular riskfactors (89 –91). For individuals with type 2\ndiabetes who require initiation or intensi-ﬁcation of glucose-lowering therapy to\nachieve and/or maintain individualized\nglycemic goals and who do not have addi-tional considerations informing choice oftherapy beyond need for glucose lower-\ning, metformin is a commonly used\nmedication that historically has been theﬁrst-line treatment for type 2 diabetes\n(92,93). Metformin is effective and safe,\nis inexpensive and widely available, and\nreduces risks of microvascular complica-tions, cardiovascular events, and death(92,94,95). Metformin is available in animmediate-release form for twice-daily\ndosing or as an extended-release form\nthat can be given once daily. Comparedwith sulfonylureas, metformin as ﬁrst--\nline therapy has bene ﬁcial effects on\nA1C, is weight neutral, does not cause\nhypoglycemia, and reduces cardiovascu-lar mortality (96). Metformin is also moreeffective than dipeptidyl peptidase 4\n(DPP-4) inhibitors in lowering A1C and\nweight when used as monotherapy (97).\nThe principal side effects of metfor-\nmin are gastrointestinal intolerance dueto bloating, abdominal discomfort, and\ndiarrhea; these can be mitigated by grad-\nual dose titration and/or using extended-release formulation. The drug is clearedby kidney ﬁltration, and metformin may\nbe safely used in people with estimated\nglomerular ﬁltration rate $30 mL/min/\n",

However, the occurrence\nof this complication is very rare (100) andprimarily occurs when the estimated glo-merular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) is <30 mL/\nmin/1.73 m\n2(101). For people with an\neGFR of 30 –45 mL/min/1.73 m2,t h e r ei s\nan increased risk for periodic decreasesof eGFR to #30 mL/min/1.73 m2which\nheightens the risk of lactic acidosis. Met-formin use is also associated with in-creased risk of vitamin B12 de ﬁciency and\nworsening of symptoms of neuropathy\n(102,103), suggesting periodic testing of\nvitamin B12 levels (see Section 3,“Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and\nAssociated Comorbidities ”).\nThe comparative glucose-lowering ef ﬁ-\ncacy of different pharmacologic agents\nhas been examined primarily in networkmeta-analyses, as few prospective clinicaltrials have compared multiple drug clas-\nses head-to-head. In general, the largest\nreductions in A1C levels are achieved bytreatment plans that include insulin, se-lect GLP-1 RAs (particularly semaglutide),\nand tirzepatide, while DPP-4 inhibitors re-\nsulted in the smallest reductions in A1C(104–106). In A Diabetes Outcome Progres-\nsion Trial (ADOPT), rosiglitazone monother-apy was more effective than metformin\nand glyburide monotherapies in achieving\nand maintaining fasting plasma glucosebelow 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) amongrecently diagnosed individuals with type 2\ndiabetes whose baseline fasting plasma\nglucose was 126 –180 mg/dL (7 –10 mmol/L),\nwhile glyburide was least effective (107).More recently, the Glycemia Reduction\nApproaches in Type 2 Diabetes: A Com-\nparative Effectiveness (GRADE) trial com-pared use of insulin glargine U-100,liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride as add-on treatments to metformin monotherapy\namong individuals with type 2 diabetes\nand baseline A1C 6.8 –8.5% (108). It found\nthat at 5 years, all therapies decreasedA1C levels but glargine and liraglutide\nwere modestly more effective in achiev-\ning and maintaining A1C below 7%, whilesitagliptin was least effective. Severe hy-poglycemia was signi ﬁcantly more com-\nmon in those prescribed glargine or\nglimepiride. An observational study thatemulated many of GRADE ’s design fea-\ntures and included canagli ﬂozin as a com-\nparator arm, but did not include insulin\nglargine, found that liraglutide was more\neffective at achieving and maintainingA1C below 7% than sitagliptin, canagli ﬂo-\nzin, or glimepiride, which all had compa-\nrable effectiveness (108).\nThus, when choosing a glucose-lowering\nmedication to achieve individualized gly-cemic goals, we recommend engaging inshared decision-making and considering\nfactors such as glucose-lowering ef ﬁcacy,\nt h es i d ee f f e c tp r o ﬁle, and medicationaccessibility and affordability (108). In all\ncases, treatment plans need to be contin-\nuously reviewed for ef ﬁcacy, side effects,\nhypoglycemia, and treatment burden(Table 9.2 ).\nWhen A1C is $1.5% above the individ-\nualized glycemic goal (see Section 6,“Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia, ”for\nappropriate goals), many individuals will\nrequire dual-combination therapy or amore potent glucose-lowering agent toachieve and maintain their goal A1C level(89) ( Fig. 9.3 and Table 9.2 ). Insulin\nshould be considered as part of any com-\nbination medication plan when hypergly-cemia is severe, especially if catabolicfeatures (weight loss, hypertriglyceride-mia, and ketosis) are present. It is com-mon practice to initiate insulin therapy\nfor people who present with blood glu-\ncose levels $300 mg/dL ( $16.7 mmol/L)\nor A1C >10% (>86 mmol/mol) or if the\nindividual has symptoms of hyperglyce-mia (i.e., polyuria or polydipsia) or evi-\ndence of catabolism (unexpected weight\nloss) ( Fig. 9.4 ). As glucose toxicity re-\nsolves, simplifying the medication planand/or changing to noninsulin agents ispossible. Additionally, there is evidencethat people with type 2 diabetes and se-\nvere hyperglycemia can also be effectively\ntreated with a sulfonylurea, a GLP-1 RA,or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, though evi-dence is scarce for individuals with base-line A1C above 10 –12% (104,109 –111).\nGLP-1 RAs and tirzepatide have additional\nbeneﬁts over insulin and sulfonylureas,\nspeciﬁcally lower risks for hypoglycemia\n(both) and favorable weight (both), car-diovascular (GLP-1 RAs), kidney (GLP-1RAs), and liver (both) end points.\nCombination Therapy\nBecause type 2 diabetes is a progressive\ndisease, maintenance of glycemic goals\noften requires combination therapy. Tra-ditional recommendations have called forthe use of stepwise addition of medica-tions to metformin to maintain A1C goals.T h ea d v a n t a g eo ft h i si st op r o v i d eac l e a r\nassessment of the positive and negative\neffects of new drugs and reduce potentialside effects and expense (112).

We do not recommend\nusing GLP-1 RAs (or the dual GIP andGLP-1 RA) together with a DPP-4 inhibitoras there is no added glucose-lowering\nbeneﬁt beyond that of the GLP-1 RA\nalone (119 –121).\nWhen even greater potency of glucose\nreduction is needed, basal insulin, eitherhuman NPH or a long-acting insulin ana-\nlog, should be initiated. However, if the\nindividual is not already receiving GLP-1RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA therapy,an agent from these classes should bestarted ﬁrst, as it may be suf ﬁcient for\nachieving individualized A1C goals but\nwith lower risk of hypoglycemia and withfavorable weight, cardiovascular, kidney,and liver pro ﬁles. While most GLP-1 RAs\nare injectable medications, an oral formu-\nlation of semaglutide is commercially avail-able (122). In trials analyzing the additionof an injectable GLP-1 RA, dual GIP and\nGLP-1 RA, or insulin in people needing fur-\nther glucose lowering, glycemic ef ﬁcacies\nof GLP-1 RAs and the dual GIP and GLP-1RA were similar to or greater than that ofbasal insulin (123 –130). GLP-1 RAs and\ndual GIP and GLP-1 RA in these trials also\nhad a lower risk of hypoglycemia and ben-eﬁcial effects on body weight compared\nwith insulin, albeit with greater gastroin-\ntestinal side effects. Thus, trial results sup-\nport high-potency GLP-1 RAs and dual GIPand GLP-1 RA as the preferred options for\nindividuals requiring more intensive glu-cose management ( Fig. 9.4 ).\nIn individuals who are intensi ﬁed to in-\nsulin therapy, combination therapy with aGLP-1 RA or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA hasbeen shown to have greater ef ﬁcacy and\ndurability of glycemic treatment effects,as well as weight and hypoglycemia bene-ﬁts, than treatment intensi ﬁcation with\ninsulin alone (89,131). However, cost, ac-cessibility, and tolerability are importantconsiderations for GLP-1 RA and dual GIPand GLP-1 RA use.\nIn all cases, treatment plans need to\nbe continuously reviewed for ef ﬁcacy,\nside effects (including hypoglycemia), andtreatment burden ( Table 9.2 ). In some\ninstances, the individual will require\nmedication reduction or discontinuation.Common reasons for this include ineffec-tiveness, hypoglycemia, intolerable sideeffects, new contraindications, expense,or a change in glycemic goals (e.g., in re-sponse to development of comorbid-ities). See below for cost considerationsof glucose-lowering therapies (\nMEDICATION\nCOSTS AND AFFORDABILITY ). Section 13, “Older\nAdults, ”has a full discussion of treatment\nconsiderations in older adults. Treatmentdeintensi ﬁcation may also be needed in\nthe setting of weight loss and/or optimiza-tion of lifestyle behaviors, when fewerpharmacologic agents are needed tomaintain A1C goals. In this case, we rec-ommend preferential deescalation oftherapies that are most likely to causeside effects, hypoglycemia, and/or treat-\nment burden and do not have cardiovas-\ncular, kidney, or metabolic bene ﬁts for\ncontinued use.\nGlucose-Lowering Therapy for\nPeople With Cardiovascular Disease\nor Risk Factors for Cardiovascular\nDisease\nFor people with type 2 diabetes and es-\ntablished ASCVD or indicators of highASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, an SGLT2 inhibi-tor and/or GLP-1 RA with demonstratedcardiovascular bene ﬁt(Table 9.2 ) is recom-\nmended independent of A1C, with or with-out metformin use, and in consideration ofperson-speci ﬁcf a c t o r s( Fig. 9.3 ).

This is particularly important\nbecause SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs\nare associated with lower risk of hypo-\nglycemia and individuals with ASCVD,HF, and CKD have higher hypoglycemia\nrisk than individuals without these condi-\ntions (132).\nIndividuals at lower risk for ASCVD\nmay still bene ﬁt from GLP-1 RA therapy\nto reduce their risk of future cardiovas-cular events.

Preferred medications for\nglucose management in individuals with\nCKD are GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors\n(can be initiated if eGFR is above 20 mL/min/1.73 m\n2). GLP-1 RAs are effective in\nlowering glucose levels, regardless of kid-\nney function, with a low risk for hypogly-\ncemia, and a recent clinical trial suggests\nthat the GLP-1 RA semaglutide has a ben-eﬁcial effect on CVD, mortality, and kid-\nney outcomes among people with CKD,diabetesjournals.org/care Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment S193Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S181/791515/dc25s009.pdf by Duke University Medical Center Library user on 10 August 2025\nleading to the recommendation that sem-\na g l u t i d ec a nb eu s e da sa n o t h e r ﬁrst-line\nagent for people with CKD (137,138).\nOther GLP-1 RAs (liraglutide and dulaglu-\ntide) may also have CKD bene ﬁts, but no\nother dedicated kidney trials have been\npublished. Similarly, no dedicated kidneyoutcomes studies for the dual GIP and\nGLP-1 RA (tirzepatide) have been pub-\nlished. Dedicated kidney outcomes trialsin people with CKD and type 2 diabetes\nhave shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors em-\npagliﬂozin, canagli ﬂozin, and dapagli ﬂozin\nhave bene ﬁcial effects on slowing progres-\nsion of CKD and CV outcomes in this popu-lation (139 –141). However, their ability to\nlower glucose levels declines when the\neGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m\n2\n(142–144). Metformin is also a preferred\nagent for those with CKD due to its well-documented ef ﬁcacy and safety pro ﬁle\nfor all people with type 2 diabetes. How-\never, there is no documented direct\nkidney bene ﬁt. Importantly, metformin\nshould not be started in those whoseeGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m\n2. For those\nalready treated with metformin, the\ndose of metformin should be reduced\nonce eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m2and\nshould be stopped once eGFR is <30 mL/\nmin/1.73 m2(98). A secondary analysis of\nthe GRADE trial found that insulin glar-\ngine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride\ndid not prevent the development of CKD\nwhen added to metformin monotherapyin individuals without underlying CKD\n(145). Importantly, an SGLT2 inhibitor\nwas not included in the GRADE trial.\nIndividuals with CKD, particularly ad-\nvanced CKD and kidney failure, are\nat high risk for hypoglycemia (132). Iftreated with insulin and/or sulfonylur-\neas, treatment needs to be closely moni-\ntored and adjusted as eGFR declines and\nindividuals need to be educated about\nand closely monitored for hypoglycemiaoccurrence (136). See Section 11, “Chronic\nKidney Disease and Risk Management, ”\nfor more details about prevention and\ntreatment of CKD in individuals with\ndiabetes.\nGlucose-Lowering Therapy for\nPeople With Metabolic Comorbidities\nMany adults with diabetes, either type 2\ndiabetes or type 1 diabetes, with obesity\nare at high risk of developing MASLD or\nMASH as well as MASH cirrhosis. Hence,t h ep r e s e n c eo fM A S L Do rM A S Hs h o u l d\nbe a consideration when choosing glucose-lowering therapies. Accruing randomized\nclinical trial data suggest that pioglitazone,GLP-1 RA, and a dual GIP and GLP-1 RAhave potential bene ﬁts in terms of decreas-\ning hepatic steatosis and in the resolution\nof MASH without worsening of ﬁbrosis in\nindividuals with biopsy-proven MASH orthose at higher risk of clinically signi ﬁcant\nliver ﬁbrosis identi ﬁed with noninvasive\ntests (146 –153). Combination therapy with\npioglitazone plus GLP-1 RA should also beconsidered for treatment of hyperglycemiain adults with type 2 diabetes with biopsy-\nproven MASH or those at higher risk of\nclinically signi ﬁcant liver ﬁbrosis identi ﬁed\nwith noninvasive tests, as such therapy issafe and effective and has been shown toreduce hepatic steatosis (154 –156). It is im-\nportant to note that these studies are\nbased on phase 2 clinical trials and awaitfurther phase 3 con ﬁrmation of evidence.\nHowever, these plans are preferred as they\noffer potential bene ﬁtc o m p a r e dw i t hl a c k\nof histological bene ﬁt (or clinical trial data)\nfrom other glucose-lowering therapies inMASLD. Further details regarding liver\nhealth in diabetes can be found in Section 4,\n“Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and\nAssessment of Comorbidities. ”\nObesity is present in over 90% of peo-\nple with type 2 diabetes, and in these in-\ndividuals weight management is a key\ntreatment goal, along with glucose lower-ing. In the setting of obesity, the choice ofglucose-lowering medications should takeinto consideration their effects on weight.\nInsulins, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidine-\ndiones can promote weight gain andshould be used judiciously and at the low-est possible dose. Glucose-lowering medi-\ncations that promote weight loss should\nbe prioritized. Of the currently availableagents, tirzepatide and semaglutide havethe highest ef ﬁcacy in terms of glucose\nlowering as well as weight loss, followed\nby dulaglutide, liraglutide, and extended-release exenatide (157 –161). Other glucose-\nlowering medications (metformin, SGLT2inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, dopamine\nagonists, bile acid sequestrants, and a-\nglucosidase inhibitors) are weight neu-tral or have a modest bene ﬁcial effect\non weight. These medications can be\nused as add-on therapies in people with\ntype 2 diabetes and obesity who requireadditional glucose lowering or if the moreeffective medications are not tolerated,\nare contraindicated, or are unavailable.\nMetabolic surgery, especially Roux-en-Ygastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy,are very effective interventions to achieve\nboth weight and glycemic goals and have\nadditional health bene ﬁts beyond im-\nproving metabolism (162). Further detailsregarding treatment of obesity can befound in Section 8 ( “Obesity and Weight\nManagement for the Prevention andTreatment of Type 2 Diabetes ”).\nInsulin Therapy\nMany adults with type 2 diabetes eventu-\nally require and bene ﬁt from insulin ther-\napy ( Fig. 9.4 ). See INSULIN ADMINISTRATION\nTECHNIQUE , above, for guidance on how to\nadminister insulin safely and effectively.The progressive nature of type 2 diabetesshould be regularly and objectively ex-plained to individuals with diabetes, andclinicians should avoid using insulin as athreat or describing it as a sign of per-sonal failure. The utility and importanceof insulin to achieve and maintain glyce-mic goals once progression of the diseaseovercomes the effect of other agents aswell as for temporary use for acute situa-tions (such as hospitalization, acute ill-ness, or high-dose glucocorticoid therapy)should be emphasized. Educating and in-volving people with diabetes in insulinmanagement is bene ﬁcial. For example,\ninstruction of individuals with type 2 dia-\nbetes initiating insulin on self-titration of\ninsulin doses based on glucose monitoringimproves glycemic management (163).Comprehensive education regarding glucosemonitoring, nutrition, physical activity,contingency planning (for illness, fasting,or medication unavailability), and the pre-vention and appropriate treatment of hy-poglycemia are critically important for allindividuals using insulin. Assessment andeducation tailored to improve health liter-acy and numeracy may be necessary forindividuals to effectively use various insu-lin dosing strategies and tools (64,65). SeeSection 5, “Facilitating Positive Health Be-\nhaviors and Well-being to Improve HealthOutcomes, ”for guidance on diabetes self-\nmanagement education.\nBasal Insulin\nBasal insulin alone is the most convenientinitial insulin treatment and can be addedto noninsulin glucose-lowering medica-tions. For individuals with type 2 diabetes,starting doses can be estimated based onbody weight (0.1 –0.2 units/kg/day) and\nthe degree of hyperglycemia, with indi-vidualized titration over days to weeks asS194 Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment Diabetes Care Volume 48, Supplement 1, January 2025Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S181/791515/dc25s009.pdf by Duke University Medical Center Library user on 10 August 2025\nneeded to achieve and maintain glycemic\ngoals. The principal action of basal insulinis to restrain hepatic glucose production\nand limit hyperglycemia overnight and\nbetween meals (164,165). Attainment offasting glucose goals can be achieved\nwith human NPH insulin or a long-acting\ninsulin analog. In clinical trials, long-acting\nbasal analogs (U-100 glargine and dete-\nmir) have been demonstrated to reducethe risk of level 2 hypoglycemia and noc-\nturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH\ninsulin (166). Longer-acting basal analogs\n(U-300 glargine or degludec) convey a\nlower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk thanU-100 glargine (167,168). It is important\nto understand how to convert individuals\nfrom one basal insulin to another, as\nswitching insulins may be required due to\nthe availability of more clinically appropriateinsulin alternatives, removal of a product\nfrom the market (i.e., insulin detemir), or\nchanges to insurance coverage. Often\ndoses can be converted unit for unit and\nsubsequently adjusted based on glucosem o n i t o r i n g ;h o w e v e r ,a ni n i t i a ld o s er e -\nduction of 10 –20% can be used for indi-\nviduals in very tight management or athigh risk for hypoglycemia and is typically\nneeded when switching from insulin de-\ntemir or U-300 glargine to another insulin\n(169). Clinicians should also be aware of\nthe potential for overbasalization with in-sulin therapy (i.e., use of higher than clini-\ncally necessary and appropriate dose of\nbasal insulin, typically masking insuf ﬁcient\nmealtime insulin). Clinical signals that\nshould prompt evaluation for overbasali-zation include high bedtime-to-morning\nor preprandial-to-postprandial glucose\ndifferential (e.g., bedtime-to-morning glucose\ndifferential $50 mg/dL [ $2.8 mmol/L]),\nhypoglycemia (aware or unaware), andhigh glucose variability. Evidence of over-\nbasalization should prompt reevaluation\nof the glucose-lowering treatment plan tobetter address postprandial hyperglyce-\nmia (170).\nCombination Injectable Therapy and Pran-\ndial Insulin\nI fb a s a li n s u l i nh a sb e e nt i t r a t e dt oa na c -\nceptable fasting blood glucose level and\nA1C remains above goal, if there is evi-\ndence of signi ﬁcant postprandial hyper-\nglycemia, or if signs of overbasalization\nare present, advancement to combination\ninjectable therapy is necessary ( Fig. 9.4 ).\nThis approach can use a GLP-1 RA or dual\nGIP and GLP-1 RA added to basal insulin ormultiple doses of prandial insulin (131,171).\nIf an individual is not already being treatedwith a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA,a GLP-1 RA (either as an individual productor in a ﬁxed-ratio combination with a basal\ninsulin product) or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA\nshould be considered prior to startingprandial insulin to address prandial man-agement and to lower the risks of hypo-\nglycemia and weight gain associated\nwith insulin therapy (131,172).\nFurther intensi ﬁcation of insulin ther-\napy entails adding doses of prandial insu-lin to basal insulin. Starting with a single\nprandial dose with the largest meal of the\nday is simple and effective, and it can beadvanced to a plan with multiple prandialdoses if necessary (173). We suggest start-\ning with a prandial insulin dose of 4 units\nor 10% of the amount of basal insulin atthe largest meal or the meal with thegreatest postprandial excursion. The pran-dial insulin plan can then be intensi ﬁed\nbased on individual needs ( Fig. 9.4 ). Alter-\nnatively, for an individual treated withbasal insulin in whom additional prandialcoverage is desired but administering in-\nsulin prior to one or more meals is not\nfeasible, the medication plan can be con-verted to two doses of a premixed insulin.Each approach has advantages and dis-\nadvantages. For example, basal-prandial\nplans offer greater ﬂexibility for individu-\nals who eat on irregular schedules, havevariable meal content, or otherwise bene ﬁt\nfrom greater individualization and ﬂexibility\nin insulin administration. On the other\nhand, two doses of premixed insulin is asimple, convenient means of spreadinginsulin across the day. Moreover, human\ninsulins, separately, self-mixed, or as pre-\nmixed NPH/regular (for example, 70/30)formulations, are often less costly alterna-tives to insulin analogs.\nIndividuals with type 2 diabetes are\ngenerally more insulin resistant than those\nwith type 1 diabetes, require higher dailydoses ( /C241 unit/kg), and have lower rates\nof hypoglycemia (174). Meta-analyses of\ntrials comparing rapid-acting insulin ana-\nlogs with human regular insulin in type 2diabetes have not reported meaningfuldifferences in A1C or hypoglycemia(175,176). Titration of prandial insulin can\nb eb a s e do nh o m es e l f - m o n i t o r e db l o o d\nglucose or CGM. When signi ﬁcant addi-\ntions to the prandial insulin dose aremade, particularly with the evening meal,\nconsideration should be given to decreas-\ning basal insulin to reduce risk ofhypoglycemia. When initiating intensi ﬁca-\ntion of insulin therapy, metformin, SGLT2inhibitors, and GLP-1 RAs (or a dual GIPand GLP-1 RA) should be maintained, un-less adverse effects (including signi ﬁcant\ntreatment burden) or contraindications\nare present. Use of sulfonylureas, megliti-nides, and DPP-4 inhibitors should be lim-ited or discontinued, as these medications\ndo not have additional bene ﬁcial effects on\ncardiovascular, kidney, weight, or liver out-comes and (for sulfonylureas and megliti-nides) increase risk of hypoglycemia and\nweight gain. Adjunctive use of pioglita-\nzone may help to improve glycemia andreduce the amount of insulin needed, al-though potential side effects should be\nconsidered.\nOnce a basal-bolus insulin plan is initi-\nated, dose titration is important, with ad-justments made in both prandial and basalinsulins based on blood glucose levels and\nan understanding of the pharmacody-\nnamic pro ﬁle of each formulation (also\nknown as pattern control or pattern man-agement). In some people with type 2 dia-\nbetes with signi ﬁcant clinical complexity,\nmultimorbidity, and/or treatment burden,it may become necessary to simplify or de-intensify complex insulin plans to decreaserisk of hypoglycemia and improve quality\nof life (see Section 13, “Older Adults ”).\nConcentrated Insulins\nConcentrated preparations may be more\nconvenient (fewer injections to achievegoal dose) and comfortable (less volume\nto inject the desired dose and/or less in-\njection effort) for individuals and may im-prove treatment plan engagement int h o s ew i t hi n s u l i nr e s i s t a n c ew h or e q u i r e\nlarge doses of insulin. Several concen-\ntrated insulin preparations are currentlyavailable. U-500 regular insulin is, by de ﬁ-\nnition, ﬁve times more concentrated than\nU-100 regular insulin. U-500 regular insulin\nhas distinct pharmacokinetics with similaronset but a delayed, blunted, and pro-longed peak effect and longer duration ofaction compared with U-100 regular insu-\nlin; thus, it has characteristics more like a\npremixed intermediate-acting (NPH) andregular insulin product and can be usedas two or three daily injections (177,178).\nU-300 glargine and U-200 degludec are\nthree and two times, respectively, as con-centrated as their U-100 formulationsand allow higher doses of basal insulin\nadministration per volume used. U-300\nglargine has a longer duration of actiondiabetesjournals.org/care Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment S195Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S181/791515/dc25s009.pdf by Duke University Medical Center Library user on 10 August 2025\nthan U-100 glargine but modestly lower\nefﬁcacy per unit administered (179 –181).\nThe U-200 formulations of insulin deglu-dec, insulin lispro, and insulin lispro-aabchave pharmacokinetics similar to thoseof their U-100 counterparts (182 –184).\nWhile U-500 regular insulin is available inboth pre ﬁlled pens and vials, other con-\ncentrated insulins are available only inpreﬁlled pens to minimize the risk of dos-\ning errors. If U-500 regular insulin vials are\nprescribed, the prescription should be ac-\ncompanied by a prescription for U-500 sy-ringes to minimize the risk of dosing errors.\nAlternative Insulin Routes\nInsulin is primarily administered via sub-cutaneous injection or infusion. Adminis-tration devices provide some additionalvariation in the subcutaneous delivery be-yond vial and syringe versus insulin pen.Those devices include continuous insulin\npumps (programmable or automated basal\nand bolus settings and ﬁxed basal and\nbolus settings) and bolus-only insulinpatch pump. In addition, prandial or cor-rection insulin doses may be administeredusing inhaled human insulin. Inhaled insu-lin is available as monomers of regular hu-man insulin; studies in individuals withtype 1 diabetes suggest that inhaled insu-lin has pharmacokinetics similar to thoseof RAA (185). Studies comparing inhaled\ninsulin with injectable insulin have dem-\nonstrated its faster onset and shorterduration compared with the RAA insulinlispro as well as clinically meaningful A1Creductions and weight reductions com-pared with the RAA insulin aspart over24 weeks (186 –188). Use of inhaled insu-\nlin may result in a decline in lung function(reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s[FEV\n1]). Inhaled insulin is contraindicated\nin individuals with chronic lung disease,such as asthma and chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease, and is not recom-\nmended in individuals who smoke or whorecently stopped smoking. All individualsrequire spirometry (FEV\n1) testing to iden-\ntify potential lung disease prior to and af-ter starting inhaled insulin therapy.\n",

E\nSeveral key aspects of insulin manage-\nment that are relevant to all peoplewith diabetes requiring insulin therapy,including available formulations, insulinplans and delivery systems, administration\ntechnique, and overbasalization, were dis-\ncussed earlier in this section.

Clini-cians should routinely review the individ-ual’s access to glucagon, as appropriate\nglucagon prescribing is low (191 –193).\nSee Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and Hy-\npoglycemia, ”for additional information\non hypoglycemia and glucagon in individ-uals with diabetes.\nMedication Costs and Affordability\nCosts for noninsulin and insulin diabetesmedications have increased dramaticallyover the past two decades, and an in-\ncreasing proportion of cost is now passed\non to people with diabetes and their fam-ilies (194). Table 9.3 provides cost infor-\nmation for currently approved noninsulintherapies, while Table 9.4 provides these\ndata for insulin. Of note, prices listed are\naverage wholesale prices (AWP) (195)and National Average Drug AcquisitionCosts (NADAC) (196); these estimates al-low for a comparison of drug prices butdo not represent the actual costs to peo-\nple with diabetes because they do not ac-\ncount for various discounts, rebates, andother price adjustments often involved inprescription sales that affect the actualcost incurred by the individual. Medica-\ntion costs can be a major source of stress\nfor people with diabetes and contributeto worse medication-taking behavior (197);cost-reducing strategies may improvemedication-taking behavior in some cases(198).\nAlthough caps on out-of-pocket costs\nfor insulin have been implemented for\nindividuals with Medicare and for indi-viduals on some commercial healthplans, and three major insulin manufac-turers have capped costs at $35 permonth per insulin (199 –202) (see Sec-\ntion 1, “Improving Care and Promoting\nHealth in Populations ”), individuals with\nhigh-deductible health plans and thosewithout insurance coverage can incur veryhigh out-of-pocket expenses for glucose-lowering therapies.

ETherapeutic Strategies With\nMedication Unavailability\nHealth care professionals and people with\ndiabetes struggle when medication sup-\nplies are insuf ﬁcient to meet the demand.\nRecent examples of such circumstancesinclude recalls involving a number of met-formin products and the marked increasein demand for agents from the GLP-1 RA\nand dual GIP and GLP-1 RA classes. The\nlatter circumstance led to such a low levelof availability that products were deter-m i n e db yt h eF D At ob ei ns h o r t a g e( 2 0 4 ) .To assist with supply of medications dur-\ning the time they are in shortage (as sig-\nnaled by their inclusion on the FDA DrugShortages Database), compounding phar-macies and outsourcing compounding fa-cilities are allowed to make copies, or\nproducts that are essentially duplicates\nof the marketed FDA-approved product(205). A signi ﬁcant number of concerning\nreports regarding safety and ef ﬁcacy of\ncompounded incretin products have\nemerged, however, including using saltforms of the FDA-approved product ’sa c -\ntive ingredient that are not proven safe oreffective for use in humans, incorporation\nof additional ingredients not clinically\nt e s t e dw h e nm i x e dw i t hi n c r e t i np r o d u c t s(e.g., vitamin B12 and vitamin B6), productsprovided in nonstandard concentrationsand doses and/or multidose vials and pre-\nﬁlled syringes not accompanied by educa-\ntion or labeling to mitigate administrationerrors, and the emergence of counterfeitproducts that pose signi ﬁcant risk to indi-\nviduals taking these products (206 –209).\nDue to safety, quality, and effectiveness\nconcerns, use of non –FDA-approved com-\npounded products is not recommended(210). Instead, consider switching to a\ndifferent FDA-approved medication as\nclinically appropriate (211). Once thedesired FDA-approved product becomesavailable, individuals should be reas-sessed to determine the appropriate-\nness of resuming the product based on\ntheir current care needs, preferences,and priorities.\nCare Considerations for Individuals\nof Childbearing Potential\nThe impact of glycemia during pregnancy\nis well understood; however, evidence forthe safe use of noninsulin glucose-lower-ing medications is limited (see Section 15,\n“Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy ”).\nStudies on the ef ﬁcacy and safety of\nglucose-lowering medications excludeindividuals who are pregnant and require\nindividuals of childbearing potential to use\none or two forms of contraception. It isrecommended that individuals of child-\nbearing potential use a form of contracep-\ntion when also taking glucose-loweringmedications with unknown risks, limitedevidence on safety, or known risks during\npregnancy, regardless of the individual ’si n -\ntention to become pregnant, as manypregnancies are unplanned. The options\nfor contraception should be discussed\nwith all individuals of childbearing poten-tial with diabetes and should include in-formation regarding the potential impact\nof glucose-lowering medications on the\neffectiveness of contraception. Medica-tions that impact gastrointestinal empty-\ning time (e.g., GLP-1 RAs or dual GIP and\nGLP-1 RA) may affect the absorption oforally administered medications, includ-ing oral contraception. The impact on\ngastric emptying with GLP-1 RAs and the\ndual GIP and GLP-1 RA is highest at initia-tion and with dosage increases and then\ndiminishes with continued administration\n(212). Tirzepatide, the dual GIP and GLP-1RA, was shown to impact the levels oforal contraception during the time of its\nhighest impact on gastric emptying; the\nGLP-1 RAs may impact the levels of oralcontraception as well but to a lesser ex-\ntent than tirzepatide (213,214). Thus, in-\ndividuals starting or increasing doses oftirzepatide who also take oral contracep-tion should use a second form of contra-\nception until the maintenance dose of\ntirzepatide is achieved and used for atleast 4 weeks (215).\nPreconception counseling should be\npart of the routine care of individuals with\ndiabetes who have childbearing potential.\nCounseling should include the known ben-eﬁts and risks of glucose-lowering medica-\ntions as well as other medications (e.g.,\nlipid-lowering and antihypertensive thera-pies) during pregnancy and recommenda-tions for when changes in medications\nshould occur prior to pregnancy (see Sec-\ntion 15, “Management of Diabetes in\nPregnancy, ”for more information on pre-\nconception counseling and glucose-lowering\ntreatment during pregnancy).\nTherapeutic Strategies for\nIndividuals Receiving Cancer\nTreatment\nHyperglycemia due to chemotherapy may\neither be transient (improving upon treat-ment cessation) or represent permanentdiabetesjournals.org/care Pharmacologic Approaches to Glycemic Treatment S197Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/48/Supplement_1/S181/791515/dc25s009.pdf by Duke University Medical Center Library user on 10 August 2025\ndiabetes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors\n(ICIs) (agents that block programmed cell\ndeath protein 1 [PD-1] and programmedcell death protein ligand 1 [PD-L1]) suppressphysiologic blocks on immune responses,\nwhich can result in autoimmune toxicities,\nincluding autoimmune diabetes (incidenceapproximately #1%). ICI-diabetes is an in-\nsulin-de ﬁcient phenotype that presents as\nacute severe hyperglycemia or DKA and\nappears to occur more abruptly thantype 1 diabetes (216 –218).Alpelisib, a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase\n(PI3K) inhibitor, frequently results in hy-\nperglycemia by inhibiting PI3K a,w h i c h\nsystemically blocks the intracellular actionof insulin, resulting in a transient state\nof insulin resistance and hyperglycemia\n(219). Hyperglycemia occurs early duringtherapy (median time of onset of about2 weeks from initiation of alpelisib) with\nan incidence of /C2460% overall and typi-\ncally resolves upon treatment cessation(220–222). Metformin is the ﬁrst-line oralagent to treat alpelsib-induced hyperglyce-\nmia, and prophylactic initiation of metfor-\nmin has been recommended for peoplewith prediabetes receiving alpelsib (223).SGLT2 inhibitors and pioglitazone are ap-\npropriate second- or third-line agents, de-\npending on side effect and clinical pro ﬁles,\nand may be used in combination with orwithout metformin. Insulin and sulfonylur-\neas should be considered last-line agents,\nas insulin can reactivate the PI3K pathway,negating the effects of alpelisib (223,224).Table 9.3 —Median monthly (30-day) AWP and NADAC of maximum approved daily dose of noninsulin glucose-lowering\nagents in the U.S.\nClass CompoundDosage strength/\nproduct (if applicable)Maximum approved\ndaily dose †Median AWP\n(min, max)*Median NADAC\n(min, max)*\nBiguanides /C15Metformin 500 mg (ER) 2,000 mg $89 ($5, $6,719) $3 ($3, $79)\n850 mg (IR) 2,550 mg $108 ($4, $189) $2\n1,000 mg (IR) 2,000 mg $87 ($3, $146) $1\n1,000 mg (ER) 2,000 mg $1,884 ($242, $7,214) $26 ($21, $31)\n500 mg (Sol) 2,000 mg $1,144 ($810, $1478) $427\nSulfonylureas (2nd generation) /C15Glimepiride 4 mg 8 mg $73 ($71, $198) $2\n/C15Glipizide 10 mg (IR) 40 mg $72 ($67, $91) $5\n10 mg (XL/ER) 20 mg $48 ($46, $48) $8\n/C15Glyburide 6 mg (micronized) 12 mg $54 ($48, $71) $13\n5 mg 20 mg $82 ($63, $432) $7\nThiazolidinedione /C15Pioglitazone 45 mg 45 mg $348 ($7, $349) $3\na-Glucosidase inhibitors /C15Acarbose 100 mg 300 mg $106 ($104, $378) $20\n/C15Miglitol 100 mg 300 mg $294 ($241, $346) $320\nMeglitinides /C15Nateglinide 120 mg 360 mg $155 $23\n/C15Repaglinide 2 mg 16 mg $878 ($799, $897) $26\nDPP-4 inhibitors /C15Alogliptin 25 mg 25 mg $234 $145\n/C15Linagliptin 5 mg 5 mg $630 $503\n/C15Saxagliptin 5 mg 5 mg $524 ($523, $524) $165\n/C15Sitagliptin 100 mg 100 mg $588 $550\nSGLT2 inhibitors /C15Bexagli ﬂozin 20 mg 20 mg $47 NA\n/C15Canagli ﬂozin 300 mg 300 mg $718 $574\n/C15Dapagli ﬂozin 10 mg 10 mg $664 $352\n/C15Empagli ﬂozin 25 mg 25 mg $733 $586\n/C15Ertugli ﬂozin 15 mg 15 mg $428 $343\nGLP-1 RAs /C15Dulaglutide 4.5 mg pen 4.5 mg ‡ $1,173 $941\n/C15Exenatide 10 mg pen 20 mg $1,020 $818\n/C15Exenatide (ER) 2 mg pen 2 mg ‡ $993 $1,101\n/C15Liraglutide 18 mg/3 mL pen 1.8 mg $929 $1,077\n/C15Semaglutide 2 mg pen 2 mg ‡ $1,162 $933\n14 mg (tablet) 14 mg $1,162 $933\nDual GIP and GLP-1 RA /C15Tirzepatide 15 mg pen 15 mg ‡ $1,283 $1,030\nBile acid sequestrant /C15Colesevelam 625 mg tabs 3.75 g $692 ($674, $712) $47\n",

Studies of metformin, DPP-4 in-\nhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs, and\npioglitazone in individuals who have un-dergone kidney, heart, or liver transplan-tation have demonstrated effectivenessand safety but are limited by small sam-\nple sizes, short follow-up, and risk of bias\nd u et or e t r o s p e c t i v eo rs i n g l e - a r mp r o -spective designs (228). Metformin shouldbe used with caution; it should not be ini-\ntiated if eGFR is <45 mL/min/1.73 m\n2,i t\nshould be stopped with eGFR $30 mL/\nmin/1.73 m2, and it should not be used in\nthe setting of clinical instability due to\nconcerns for acute kidney injury and lactic\nacidosis. Metformin use may be associ-ated with lower risks of cardiac allographvasculopathy after heart transplantation(229) and all-cause, malignancy-related,\nand infection-related mortality after kid-\nney transplantation (230). GLP-1 RA ther-apy may be preferred for many individualsdue to the demonstrated bene ﬁto fG L P - 1\nRAs on cardiovascular, kidney, weight, and\nliver outcomes. Studies have not found ev-idence of drug interaction with immuno-suppression, including ﬁnding no changes\nin dosing or toxicity (231 –233). SGLT2\ninhibitors may be similarly preferred forindividuals with ASCVD, HF, and CKD andappear to be safe and effective in post-transplantation diabetes. However, there\nis increased risk of genitourinary tract infec-\ntion, which is a concern in individuals receiv-ing immunosuppression and in those whohave undergone kidney transplantation.\nIndividuals with maturity-onset diabe-\ntes of the young due to HNF1A and\nHNF4A mutations can be treated with\nlow-dose sulfonylurea therapy but mayultimately require insulin therapy (234)\n(see Section 2, “Diagnosis and Classi ﬁcation\nof Diabetes ”)(Table 2.7 ). For those withHNF1A mutations, addition of a DPP-4\ninhibitor to the sulfonylurea may helpimprove glycemic variability and attain-ment of glycemic goals (235). Individu-als with neonatal diabetes due to KCNJ22\nandABCC8 mutations can be treated with\nhigh-dose sulfonylureas, while those withINS,GATA6 ,EIF2AK3 ,a n d FOXP3 muta-\ntions require insulin therapy (234).\nSGLT Inhibition and Risk of Ketosis\nIndividuals with type 1 diabetes (84,236)\nand insulin-de ﬁcient type 2 diabetes are at\nincreased risk for DKA with SGLT inhibitortherapy. SGLT inhibitor –associated DKA\noccurs in approximately 4% of people\nwith type 1 diabetes; the risk can be 5 –17\ntimes higher than that in people with T1Dnot treated with SGLT inhibitors (237). Itis important to note that SGLT2 inhibitors\nare not approved for use in people with\ntype 1 diabetes. In contrast, DKA is un-common in people with type 2 diabetest r e a t e dw i t hS G L Ti n h i b i t o r s ,w i t ha ne s t i -\nmated incidence of 0.6 –4.9 events per\n1,000 person-years (238). Risk factors forDKA in individuals with either type 1 ortype 2 diabetes treated with SGLT inhibi-tors include very-low-carbohydrate diets,\nprolonged fasting, dehydration, excessive\nalcohol intake, and other common precip-itating factors (84,236). Up to a third ofpeople treated with SGLT2 inhibitors who\ndeveloped DKA present with glucose levels\n<200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) (239), and in\none study 71% presented with glucose lev-els#250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) (240);\ntherefore, it is important to educate at-\nrisk individuals about the signs and symp-toms of DKA and DKA mitigation andmanagement and to prescribe accurate\ntools for ketone measurement. Individuals\nwho have experienced DKA should not betreated with SGLT inhibition. Additionalguidance on DKA risk mitigation is avail-able in Section 6, “Glycemic Goals and\nHypoglycemia. ”\nReferences\n1.
