## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Why change from our current document-based approach?**
A: While documentation is excellent, it lacks task tracking, automation, and visibility. We'll keep the docs and add GitHub project management for active work.

**Q: Will we lose our existing documentation?**
A: No! All documentation stays. We're adding capabilities, not replacing what works.

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: 6 months for full implementation, but you'll see benefits starting in Month 2.

**Q: What does this cost?**
A: Zero ongoing software cost (free tier). One-time implementation: $2,875 (or less if DIY).

### Technical Questions

**Q: Can we roll back if it doesn't work?**
A: Yes! We maintain documents as backup and can export GitHub data anytime.

**Q: Will this integrate with our current workflows?**
A: Yes, GitHub is already your code repository. This extends it to project management.

**Q: What about offline access?**
A: GitHub mobile app works offline. Documentation remains accessible as before.

**Q: How does automation work?**
A: GitHub Actions automatically handle routine tasks (labeling, status updates, etc.).

### Adoption Questions

**Q: Will I have to change how I work?**
A: Some changes, but gradual with full support. You'll track work in issues instead of just documents.

**Q: What if I don't like using GitHub for project management?**
A: We'll provide training and support. If you still struggle, we can adjust the approach.

**Q: How much time will this save me?**
A: Estimated 136 hours per year per person through automation and better tools.

**Q: When do I need to start using the new system?**
A: Gradually. Training in Week 5, guided practice for 2 weeks, then full usage.
