# Santiago: Four-Layer Model Lessons Learned

## Four-Layer Architecture for Clinical Knowledge Processing

The Santiago service implements a four-layer model for processing clinical guidelines and knowledge:

1. **Layer 1: Raw Text Processing**
   - Input: Clinical guideline documents (PDFs, text)
   - Processing: NLP extraction, entity recognition, relationship identification
   - Output: Structured text with identified clinical concepts

2. **Layer 2: Structured Knowledge Representation**
   - Input: Processed clinical concepts from Layer 1
   - Processing: Ontology mapping, taxonomy classification, knowledge graph construction
   - Output: Structured clinical knowledge in graph format

3. **Layer 3: Computable Logic and Rules**
   - Input: Structured knowledge from Layer 2
   - Processing: Rule extraction, logic formalization, decision criteria definition
   - Output: Executable clinical logic and decision rules

4. **Layer 4: Executable Workflows and Actions**
   - Input: Computable logic from Layer 3
   - Processing: Workflow orchestration, action sequencing, outcome generation
   - Output: Executable clinical workflows and recommendations

## Four-Layer Model Evolution

| Layer | Version 01 (Current Implementation) | Version 02 (NeuroSymbolic Enhancement) |
|-------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Layer 1: Raw Text** | Basic NLP extraction, entity recognition | Neural NLP with clinical language models, advanced entity disambiguation |
| **Layer 2: Structured Knowledge** | Simple ontology mapping, basic graph construction | NeuroSymbolic knowledge graphs with embeddings, symbolic reasoning over graphs |
| **Layer 3: Computable Logic** | Rule-based logic extraction, basic decision trees | Hybrid neural-symbolic reasoning, probabilistic logic, uncertainty handling |
| **Layer 4: Executable Workflows** | Sequential workflow execution, basic orchestration | Dynamic workflow generation, multi-path reasoning, adaptive execution |
